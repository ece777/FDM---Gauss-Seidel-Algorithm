# FDM-Gauss-Seidel-Algorithm
The script solve the Laplace equation to find the Electric Field (E) and Current Density (J) using Gauss-Seidel Algorithm.
Later the resistance of a certain asymmetric metal structure is calculated.
The result of E and J are saved in separate .csv file, which can be plotted later with program like Origin.

The structure here is a top pad of memristor crossbar.
